# Reinforcement Learning for Recommender Systems

## Summary 

Most practical recommender systems focus on estimating immediate user engagement without considering the long-term effects of recommendations on user behaviour. Reinforcement learning (RL) methods offer the potential to optimize recommendations for long-term user engagement. However, since users are often presented with slates of multiple items—which may have interacting effects on user choice—methods are required to deal with the combinatorics of the RL action space.

Google’s​ [SlateQ](https://research.google/pubs/pub48200/) algorithm addresses this challenge by decomposing the long-term value (LTV) of a slate into a tractable function of its component item-wise LTVs. In this repo, we compare the efficiency of SlateQ to other RL methods like Q-learning that don’t decompose the LTV of a slate into its component-wise LTVs.

## Results

Empirically, we've shown that the SlateQ algorithm outperforms traditional Q-learning approaches across multiple metrics in our simulated environment.

## Environment

Here, we explore the interest evolution environment from [`RecSim`](https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/11/recsim-configurable-simulation-platform.html) ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/google-research/recsim)) library to train RL agents.
